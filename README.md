> Posturize targets employees sitting on the chair for a long period of time and suffering from spine pain caused by poor sitting posture and helps them maintain a good one by monitoring it, providing a user-friendly platform that notifies user when a poor sitting posture is detected.

### User Stories
Employee Stories
- As an employee, I want to receive notifications on my mobile device when my sitting posture is incorrect, so that I can adjust my posture and prevent spine pain caused by prolonged sitting.
- As an employee, I want the system to provide guidance on how to correct my sitting posture when it detects that it's incorrect, so that I can improve my posture over time.
- As an employee with a history of spine pain due to poor sitting posture, I want the system to track my sitting habits over time and provide insights and recommendations for improving my posture, so that I can prevent future health problems.

Physiotherapist Stories 
- As a physiotherapist, I want to access data about my patients' sitting habits and posture over time, so that I can provide personalized recommendations for improving their posture and reducing back pain.
- As a physiotherapist, I want to receive real-time notifications when my patients exhibit poor sitting posture, so that I can intervene promptly and provide immediate feedback or guidance to help them correct their position.
- As a physiotherapist, I want to track the effectiveness of posture correction interventions prescribed to my patients, so that I can make informed adjustments to their treatment plans and optimize their rehabilitation outcomes.

###  Posturize is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Native app development framework](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/). React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- The backend of the app is built using the [Laravelframework](https://laravel.com/). Laravel is a popular PHP framework known for its elegant syntax, extensive feature set, and developer-friendly tools, making it ideal for building robust backends for mobile applications.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [Expo Notifications](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
- For the live chat feature, the app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), which provide real-time data synchronization and reliable cloud storage.
